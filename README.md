# Face-mask-Detection

the project summary is to detect whether a human is wearing a mask or not or wearing a mask but in correct way? 
this project is from multi classification problem

python packages :

1) numpy
2) pandas
3) matplotlib
4) seaborn
5) tensorflow (keras)
6) from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
7) from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping
8) from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
9) from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import LearningRateScheduler,ReduceLROnPlateau
10) from tensorflow.keras import layers
11) from tensorflow.keras.applications import MobileNetV2,EfficientNetB0
12) from tensorflow.keras.applications.mobilenet_v2 import preprocess_input

questions :
1) get the information how many files is belong to what classes and how many files is used for training ?
2) get the class names of the data?
3) read a photo of wearing mask and non wearing mask and incorrect wearing mask?
4) use MobileNetV2 pre trained model and add the input layer ?
5) add to the model by using average pooling layer and flatten it?
6) add hidden layer and use drop out and input another hidden layer and output layer?
7) train the model 10 times and see if there is overfitting or underfitting?
8) plot the images with their class name?
